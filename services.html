          <tr>
            <tr><strong>Bathing:</strong></tr><br>
            <tr> Pets are bathed using specialized shampoos and conditioners tailored 
              to their fur and skin types. This process helps clean the pet, removes dirt, and reduces shedding.
            </tr><br>
            <tr><strong>Brushing and Comb:</strong></tr><br>
            <tr>Regular brushing helps prevent matting in a pet's coat, removes loose hair, 
              and keeps their fur shiny. Some pets, especially those with long or thick coats, 
              require frequent brushing to avoid tangles.
            </tr><br>
            <tr><strong>Nail Clipping:</strong></tr><br>
            <tr>Trimming a pet's nails is crucial for their comfort and health. 
              Long nails can cause discomfort, affect walking, and even lead to injuries.<br>
            </tr>
            <tr><strong>Ear Cleaning:</strong></tr><br>
            <tr>Pet groomers clean the ears to prevent infections caused by buildup of wax or debris, 
              particularly in breeds with floppy ears.<br>

              to reduce plaque buildup and prevent dental problems.</tr><br>
              <tr><strong>Haircuts and Styling:</strong></tr><br>
              <tr>Some pets, especially those with long coats, may require professional haircuts.
                 Our groomers are skilled in trimming or styling pets according to breed standards 
                 or individual preferences.
              </tr><br>
              <tr><strong>Flea and Tick Treatments:</strong></tr><br>
              <tr>Many pet grooming services include treatments to prevent or remove fleas and ticks, 
                ensuring the pet is free of these pests.
              </tr><br>
              <tr><strong>Skin and Coat Treatments:</strong></tr><br>
              <tr> If a pet has skin issues such as dryness, irritation, or hotspots, groomers 
                may offer special treatments like soothing baths or medicated shampoos.
