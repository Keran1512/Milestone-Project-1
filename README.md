Problems

-Looked back through videos to help remember some HTML functions such as tables and list

-Asked for help on Slack with CSS style not applying to my code.

-Tables weren't responsive on Services and Prices page so looked for help on She Codes website.

-Logo wouldn't resize properly so used Stack Overflow for help with resizing

-I didn't know how to embed map from Google in I-frame so watch video on Youtube.

-Couldn't get my social media fa-cons to stay in the middle of the page so used Stack Overflow
